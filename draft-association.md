--- abstract

This documents aims to document the relation between Internet protocol and the right to freedom of assembly and association. The Internet increasingly mediates our lives and thus the ability to excise human rights. Since Internet protocols play a central role in the management, development and use of the Internet the relation between the two SHOULD be documented and adverse impact on this human right SHOULD be mitigated
