Introduction
============

    "There's a freedom about the Internet: As long as we accept the
       rules of sending packets around, we can send packets containing
       anything to anywhere."

{{Berners-Lee}}

The Human Rights Protocol Consideration Proposed Research Group aims
to research whether standards and protocols can enable, strengthen or
threaten human rights, as defined in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights {{UDHR}} and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights {{ICCPR}}, specifically, but not limited to the
right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom of assembly.

Comunications between peple working on human rights and engineers
working on Internet protocols can be improved with a shared vocabulary.

This document aims to provide a shared vocabulary to facilitate
understanding of the intersection between human rights and Internet
protocol design.
