Introduction
============

The design of the Internet through protocols and standards is a technical issues with great poltical and econmic impacts {{RFC0603}}. The early Internet community already realized that it needed to make decisions on political issues such as Intellectual Property Rights, Internationzalization {{BramanI}}, diversity, access {{RFC0101}} privacy and security {{RFC0049}}, and the military {{RFC0164}} {{RFC0316}}, governmental {{RFC0144}} {{RFC0286}} {{RFC0313}} {{RFC0542}} {{RFC0549}} and non-governmental {{RFC0196}} uses, which has been clearly pointed out by Braman {{BramanII}}. 

Recently there has been an increased discussion on the relation between Internet protocols and human rights {{hrpc}} which spurred the discussion on the political nature of protocols. In this document we aim to outline different views on the relation between protocols and politics and seeks to answer the question whether protocols are political.
