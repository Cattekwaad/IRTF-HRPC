--- abstract

This document present an overview of the project to map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion and protection of the freedom of expression and association. It is intended to provide the framework for the study and initial results. At a later stage it will fold in the work being done in the Methodology and Glossary drafts.

# Background

The recognition that human rights have a role in Internet policies has become part of the general discourse.  Several reports from former United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, have made such relation explicit, which lead to the approval of the landmark resolution "on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet" at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).  And, more recently, to the resolution "The right to privacy in the digital age" at the UN General Assembly.  The NETmundial outcome document affirms that human rights, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR], should underpin Internet governance principles.

Nevertheless, the direct relation between Internet Standards and human rights is still something to be explored and more clearly demonstrated. 

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first Internet protocols.  Apparently, by intention or by coincidence, the Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as core values.  But as the scale and the commercialization of the
Internet has grown, the influence of such world-views had to compete with other values, such as ease of development and cost. The purose of this research is to discover and document the consideration invovled in taking human rights into account when creating protocols.

## Theory

When looking at protocols the considerations can apply from several perspectives. 

+   The protocol's effects on human rights on the Internet.
+   The protocol's effect  on humanr rights in combination with other protocols
+   The effect of specific protocol elemements, seperately or in combination with other protocl elements on human rights on the Internet
+   The ability to determine when various effects are occuring
+   The effect of deployment or non deployment.  While this may be may seem beyond the protocl itself, often the design of protocol, its difficulty in implementation and the degree to which it contain poison pills or other protocol artifacts that discourse implementation or deployment can be signifant in the over human rights affect of a protocol.

# Methodology

Currently defined in detaiil in draft-varon-hrpc-methodolgy to be folded in at appropriate time

Briefly methodolgy has included:
+ scoping the research problem
+ determining terminology to be use linking engineering and human rights concepts
+ establoshing methology
+ case studies on a set of protocols
+ derivation of possible considerations

# Case Studies

In each of the case studies, the behavior of the protocols is anlysed for its postive and negative effects.  In some case these effects are due to the design of the protocol itself, in others they are due to existing or absent features.

Early versions of the analysis on the following protocols are currently being discussed on list.  Once the discussion have matured those discussions will be folded in this section.

## IP

## HTTP
