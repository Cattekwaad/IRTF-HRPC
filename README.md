# IRTF-HRPC
This is the repository for the Internet Research Taskforce (IRTF) Human Rights Protocol Consideration (hrpc) Research Group.

We're currently experimenting with how we're managing version control. We're currently using the mailinglist [0] etherpads [1] [2] an ethercalc [3] and this repository. Currently I'll try to keep it all updated and then we'll decide on what works best.
