--- abstract

This document present an overview of the project to map engineering concepts at the protocol level that may be related to promotion and protection of the freedom of expression and association. It is intended to provide the framework for the study and initial results. At a later stage it will fold in the work being done in the Methodology and Glossary drafts.

* Background

The recognition that human rights have a role in Internet policies has become part of the general discourse.  Several reports from former United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue, have made such relation explicit, which lead to the approval of the landmark resolution "on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet" at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).  And, more recently, to the resolution "The right to privacy in the digital age" at the UN General Assembly.  The NETmundial outcome document affirms that human rights, as reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights [UDHR], should underpin Internet governance principles.

Nevertheless, the direct relation between Internet Standards and human rights is still something to be explored and more clearly demonstrated. 

Concerns for freedom of expression and association were a strong part of the world-view of the community involved in developing the first Internet protocols.  Apparently, by intention or by coincidence, the Internet was designed with freedom and openness of communications as core values.  But as the scale and the commercialization of the
Internet has grown, the influence of such world-views had to compete with other values, such as ease of development and cost. The purose of this research is to discover and document the consideration invovled in taking human rights into account when creating protocols.

*** Theory

When looking at human rights procols consideration, several perspectives are possible:



*** Evidence from research

* Methodology

Currently in draft- to be folded in at appropriate time

* Case Studies
** DNS
** IP
** HTTP
** XMPP

** Possible areas for protocol considerations

* Next Steps

* Terminology

Currently in draft-  to be folded in at appropriate time
